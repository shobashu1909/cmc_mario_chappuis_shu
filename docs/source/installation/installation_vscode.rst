Visual Studio code installation
===============================

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates basic tools required to write and test software.

Developers use numerous tools throughout software code creation, building and testing. 
Development tools often include text editors, code libraries, compilers and test platforms. 
An IDE brings many of those development-related tools together as a single framework, application or service.
The integrated toolset is designed to simplify software development and can identify and minimize coding mistakes and typos.
