Setup python dependencies
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The final step before starting of with the exercise is to install a few
necessary packages. We will be using :math:`pip` to this.

-  Open terminal (command prompt on Windows)

-  Navigate in the terminal to the exercise repository on your computer

-  Activate your virtual environment

-  Execute the following command once you are in the root of the
   repository:

   .. code:: bash

      $ pip install -r requirements.txt

   .. code:: bash

      $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

   Use :math:`pip` or :math:`pip3` depending on the one that refers to python3


The *requirements.txt* installs the following packages:

-  numpy : Scientific computing package for python

-  matplotlib : Matlab like plotting tool for python

-  farms_pylog : Module for logging messages during code runtime
